# Local Line QA Challenge

## Challenge

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate your QA automation skillset. In this repository is a simple pure `.js` game of `tic-tac-toe`. You can see it hosted [here](https://localline.github.io/QA-Automation-Specialist-Challenge/). To complete the challenge, please perform the following.

1. Fork the repository to your personal github account. 
2. Using the automation tool of your choice, `e.g. Selenium, Cypress, Playwright`, showcase how you would test this app. All scripts should be saved in the `tests` directory.
3. Any bugs encountered should be recorded in whichever convention you prefer and included in this repository. 
4. Once you've completed the work, push it to your forked repository, and submit a pull request to this repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

1) Code style
2) Test case thoroughness
3) Bug reporting style


## Game Rules

- Two players take turns: placing 'X' and 'O' marks in empty spaces on a 3x3 square grid.
- Player with the 'X' mark starts first. The first player to place 3 marks in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row wins the game.
- If all spaces are filled, the game ends in a draw.
